For Valuation at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

Full write-up of results and conclusion is in Shout_Option_Valuation_Project.pdf.

## Assignment parameters:
"You will assume the role of an exotic equity derivatives analyst, price the shout option, determine the optimal exercise strategy, and provide traders instructions on how to best hedge the shout option using traded options.  Finally, you will prepare a profitability and risk assessment for management.  A complete day in the life of a desk quant!"

## Instructions/Checklist:
0.  Reparameterize this model to reflect options on the S&P 500 index using market data

1.  Re-do the shout example using traded option prices that expire on the shout date and the maturity date

2. Price the traded options using the Black-Scholes model and benchmarking


3.  Use the benchmarking technique to revalue the option using traded option prices.

4.  Prepare a recommendation for your trading staff on how to hedge the shout option with no more than two traded options

5.  Assume you price this option for clients at a 3 point vol spread.  What is your expected profitability and the risk of the trade?

6. BONUS * Use the VIX traded futures contract as one of the available hedging instruments

Turn in your Excel spreadsheet or Python notebook, along with a short Word or PDF writeup of the product and the results.  Pricing, hedging, risk assessment.
